# 🪨 Rock Paper Scissors Game ✂️📄

Hey there! 👋  
This is my first ever **fully functional mini-project** — a fun and simple **Rock Paper Scissors** game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

I created this to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and to finally bring everything I’ve learned so far together in a small project. Hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed building it!

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Choose **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors** by clicking one of the buttons.
2. The computer will randomly choose its move.
3. You'll immediately see the result — whether you won, lost, or tied.
4. Your score is saved using `localStorage`, so it stays even after you refresh the page!
5. Want to reset your score? Click the **Reset Score** button.
